                                    progress, women remain underrepresented in tech. Our school aims to increase this

                                    leadership roles. We aim to support women in breaking through these barriers and

                                    challenges and advance in their careers.

                                    off, and many leave due to poor work-life balance. Our schoolâ€™s flexible, self-paced

                                    women to bridge this pay gap and earn equal wages for equal work.
